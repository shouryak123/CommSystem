# communication-systems
created a communication system on matlab app builder
<br>
takes input from user and convets text file,image or audio file into bits then uses Hamming 7,4 or BCH 127,64 or BCH 63,51 channel coding. User can select between five different modulation schemes with different SNR values.
<br> 
QPSK,16-QAM,64-QAM,16-FSK, and 64-FSK. Creates 3 graphs - the  constellation diagram ,power spectral density and time domain signal- comparing between noisy and without noise.
<br>
then it demodulates and decodes the bits and regenerates the inputed file.
