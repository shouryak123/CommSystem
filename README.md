# communication-systems
created a communication system on matlab app builder
<br>
takes input from user and converts textfile,image or audio file into bits.User can select between Hamming 7,4 or BCH 127,64 or BCH 63,51 channel coding.
<br>
User can select between five different modulation schemes with different SNR values.
<br> 
QPSK,16-QAM,64-QAM,16-FSK, and 64-FSK. 
<br>
Creates 3 graphs - the  constellation diagram ,power spectral density and time domain signal- the graphs compare the modualtion with and without noise.
<br>
then it demodulates and decodes the bits and regenerates the inputed file.
